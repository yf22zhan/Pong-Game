# Pong-Game

This is my very first SFML game that I built with the help of the tutorial http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition.aspx#CPlusPlus

Some key ideas from the tutorial are: 
  - ServiceLocator Design Pattern,  
  - Caching Audio Resources
  - State Driven Game Design
  - Game Object Manager
  
My own flare to it:
  - Game Start Countdown
  - Score Counter
  - Modified Paddle AI
  
Also because I used SFML 2.0 while the tutorial used 1.6, Some keywords and local code structure might be different but the idea is basically the same.
